I'm a product content engineer at [Collibra](http://www.collibra.com), building out-of-the-box Data Governance solutions. Freshly graduated with a master's in Business Analysis, I spend my days understanding technical concepts and collaborating with Product, Engineering, and customer-facing teams to deliver ready-to-use configurations. Basically accelerating adoptions and reducing the time to value.

My life's work is being so good at what I do that people can't ignore it, and only the best is good enough. I love imagining solutions, then building stuff without knowing how, learning, iterating, and eventually sharing people what I learned.

My hobbies are exploring the outdoors (WIP Alps mountains), discovering new tastes, building products, and reading essays (current reading list ; [_Thus Spake Zarathustra_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra) , [_The Prince_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince) ).
