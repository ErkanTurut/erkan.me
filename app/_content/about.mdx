I'm a product content engineer at [Collibra](https://www.collibra.com/), where I help organizations make sense of AI governance systems that actually work for their business. Freshly graduated with a master's in Business Analysis, I spend my days understanding complex technical concepts and figuring out how to build great stuff with them.

My life's work is being so good at what I do that people can't ignore it, while constantly diving into things I have zero clue about initially. I'm an obsessed overthinker who somehow comes across as surprisingly calm.

Currently working my way through hiking the entire Alps mountain chain (Switzerland and Dolomites down, many peaks to go) and struggling through Nietzsche's "Thus Spake Zarathustra" (yeah idk).

You can read my [writing](/writing), check out my [code](https://github.com/ErkanTurut), or follow me [online](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erkanturut/). I write about concepts that fascinate me, share thoughts that might be worth your time, and believe in having an impact rather than just passing by.
