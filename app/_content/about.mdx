I'm a product content engineer at [Collibra](http://www.collibra.com), building out-of-the-box Data Governance solutions that help customers actually use what they bought. Freshly graduated with a master's in Business Analysis, I spend my days understanding technical concepts and collaborating with Product, Engineering, and customer-facing teams to deliver ready-to-use configurations. Basically accelerating adoptions and reducing the time to value.

My life's work is being so good at what I do that people can't ignore it, while constantly diving into things I have zero clue about initially. I love spotting problems around me, imagining solutions, then building stuff without knowing howâ€”learning, iterating, and eventually showing people what I made.

Currently working my way through the entire Alps mountain chain (Switzerland and Dolomites down, many peaks to go) and struggling through Nietzsche's "Thus Spake Zarathustra" (idk why).

You can read my [writing](/writing), check out my [code](https://github.com/ErkanTurut), or follow me [online](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erkanturut/). I write about concepts that fascinate me, share thoughts that might be worth your time, and believe in having an impact rather than just passing by.
