I'm a product content engineer at [Collibra](http://www.collibra.com), building out-of-the-box Data Governance solutions. Freshly graduated with a master's in Business Analysis, I spend my days understanding technical concepts and collaborating with Product, Engineering, and customer-facing teams to deliver ready-to-use configurations. Basically accelerating adoptions and reducing the time to value.

My life's work is being so good at what I do that people can't ignore it, while constantly diving into things I have zero clue about initially. I love spotting problems around me, imagining solutions, then building stuff without knowing how—learning, iterating, and eventually showing people what I made.

Currently working my way through the entire Alps mountain chain (Switzerland and Dolomites down, many peaks to go) and my current reading list : _Thus Spake Zarathustra_ , _The Prince_ .

You can read my [writing](/writing), check out my [code](https://github.com/ErkanTurut), or follow me [online](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erkanturut/). I write about concepts that fascinate me, share thoughts that might be worth your time, and believe in having an impact rather than just passing by.
